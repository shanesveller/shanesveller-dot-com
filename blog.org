    I've recently assembled a workflow for blogging with [[https://gohugo.io/][Hugo]], [[http://orgmode.org/][org-mode]], and
    [[https://www.netlify.com/][Netlify]] via a single ~.org~ document, with live reload during writing and ~git
    push~ driven deployments.

**** Requirements

     I've detailed my current environment in the
     [[#ox-hugo-software-tool-versions][Software/Tool Versions]] appendix below.
     Strictly speaking, the hard requirements of the
     [[https://melpa.org/#/ox-hugo][ox-hugo]] package are:

     - Emacs 24.4+
     - org-mode 9.0+

     To use the ~git~-based publishing part of this workflow, you'll also need:

     - A GitHub account (free or otherwise)
     - A Netlify account (free or otherwise)

**** Features

     - Compose and organize content in a single Org file
     - Each post automatically gets a Table of Contents if sub-headings are present
     - Preview in your local browser including live-reload behavior
     - Syntax highlighting, including custom line numbers and line highlights
     - Manage draft / publication status
     - Manage categories and tags
     - Manage post aliases
     - Manage custom front-matter
     - Publish via ~git push~, perhaps via [[https://magit.vc/][Magit]]
     - Free hosting via Netlify (dear Netlify, please let me give you money
       without a multi-user/Pro account!)
     - Free HTTPS via Netlify's Lets Encrypt integration

**** Installation

     I've included snippets for ~use-package~ users and Spacemacs users - others
     should look at the repository for the ~ox-hugo~ package for more
     information.
***** ~use-package~ Users

      #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
        (use-package ox-hugo
          :after ox)
      #+END_SRC

***** Spacemacs Users

      Use @@html:<kbd>@@ SPC f e d @@html:</kbd>@@ to open ~\~/.spacemacs~ (or
      ~\~/.spacemacs/init.el~) and within the ~dotspacemacs/layers~ function, add or
      update an entry to the ~dotspacemacs-configuration-layers~ list like so:

      #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
        (org :variables
             org-enable-hugo-support t)
      #+END_SRC

      Restart emacs or use @@html:<kbd>@@ SPC f e R @@html:</kbd>@@ to reload your
      configuration on-the-fly. If you already have an entry for the ~org~ layer,
      just include the variable ~org-enable-hugo-support~ with value ~t~.

      There are several options for organizing the ~.org~ file you store your blog
      posts and pages in, but here's one that works well for me. Some highlights
      include:

      - Automatic export upon save as documented on the ox-hugo site
      - Manage multiple types of Hugo content from one file
        - Manage traditional blog posts (~blog~ type in my site)
        - Manage static pages that disable most blog-like functionality (~page~
          type in my site)
      - Direct control of content ordering via ~EXPORT_HUGO_WEIGHT: auto~ - just
        change the order of your Org headings to reorder content on your Hugo
        site

**** Bonus: Live reload without a separate shell tab

     If you enable the ~prodigy~ layer in Spacemacs, or install the ~Prodigy~
     package manually, you can define a process in your
     ~dotspacemacs/user-config~ function like so:

     #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
   (prodigy-define-service
     :name "Hugo Personal Blog"
     :command "/usr/local/bin/hugo"
     :args '("server" "-D" "--navigateToChanged" "-t" "hugo-redlounge")
     :cwd "~/src/shanesveller-dot-com"
     :tags '(personal)
     :stop-signal 'sigkill
     :kill-process-buffer-on-stop t)
     #+END_SRC

     Then, to manage the process while editing with Emacs, I use @@html:<kbd>@@ SPC a
     S @@html:</kbd>@@ to open the Prodigy buffer, highlight the service entry, and
     use @@html:<kbd>@@ s @@html:</kbd>@@ to start the process, @@html:<kbd>@@ S
     @@html:</kbd>@@ to stop the service, and @@html:<kbd>@@ $ @@html:</kbd>@@ to
     view process output. @@html:<kbd>@@ q @@html:</kbd>@@ will back out of any
     Prodigy-generated buffers.

    :EXPORT_AUTHOR: Shane Sveller
    :EXPORT_FILE_NAME: monitoring-gke-with-coreos-prometheus-operator
    :EXPORT_HUGO_WEIGHT: auto
    :END:

**** Background

 [[https://prometheus.io/][Prometheus]] is all the rage in the Kubernetes community, especially after
 becoming a Cloud Native Computing Foundation [[https://www.cncf.io/projects/][hosted project]].

 CoreOS has a project called [[https://github.com/coreos/prometheus-operator][prometheus-operator]] which helps manage instances
 of a Prometheus server, or its compatriot AlertManager, via Kubernetes manifests.

**** Getting Started

 I've chosen to install the Operator via the project's provided [[https://github.com/coreos/prometheus-operator/tree/v0.15.0/helm/prometheus-operator][Helm Chart]].

 First, install CoreOS' Helm repository

 #+BEGIN_SRC shell-script
   helm init --client-only
   helm repo add coreos https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/coreos-charts/stable/
 #+END_SRC

 I've also provided some customized values:

 #+BEGIN_SRC yaml
   global:
     ## Hyperkube image to use when getting ThirdPartyResources & cleaning up
     ##
     hyperkube:
       repository: quay.io/coreos/hyperkube
       # https://quay.io/repository/coreos/hyperkube?tag=latest&tab=tags
       tag: v1.8.4_coreos.0
       pullPolicy: IfNotPresent

   ## Prometheus-operator image
   ##
   image:
     repository: quay.io/coreos/prometheus-operator
     # https://quay.io/repository/coreos/prometheus-operator?tag=latest&tab=tags
     tag: v0.15.0
     pullPolicy: IfNotPresent
 #+END_SRC

 Finally, I install the chart with my supplied values in a ~monitoring~ namespace:

 #+BEGIN_SRC shell-script
   helm install --name prometheus-operator \
        --namespace monitoring \
        --values prometheus-operator-values.yaml \
        coreos/prometheus-operator
 #+END_SRC

**** Using kube-prometheus for basic cluster metrics

 #+BEGIN_SRC shell-script
   helm install --name kube-prometheus \
        --namespace monitoring \
        --values kube-prometheus-values.yaml \
        coreos/kube-prometheus
 #+END_SRC

** Terraform
*** DONE Managing GitLab groups and projects with Terraform
    CLOSED: [2017-12-17 Sun 10:57]
    :PROPERTIES:
    :EXPORT_DATE: 2017-12-17
    :EXPORT_FILE_NAME: managing-gitlab-with-terraform
    :END:

**** Configuring the provider

     The following Terraform syntax can be used with the public/commercial
     GitLab.com service or with a self-hosted installation, as long as you have
     network connectivity and a token with the correct permissions. I'm using
     the latter.

     In my case, I used a *Personal Access Token* associated with my individual
     administrative account, with these permissions:

     - ~api~
     - ~read_user~

     #+BEGIN_SRC hcl
       variable "gitlab_token" {
         type = "string"
       }

       variable "gitlab_url" {
         type    = "string"
         default = "https://gitlab.mydomain.com/api/v4/"
       }

       provider "gitlab" {
         base_url = "${var.gitlab_url}"
         token    = "${var.gitlab_token}"
         version  = "~> 1.0.0"
       }
     #+END_SRC

     If you'd like to keep these out of your source code, Terraform also allows
     setting variables in shell environment variables by prefixing them with
     ~TF_VAR_~, as in ~TF_VAR_gitlab_token~ and ~TF_VAR_gitlab_url~. You can
     manage these manually or with a tool like [[https://direnv.net/][direnv]],
     and keep the latter's ~.envrc~ file in your ~.gitignore~.

**** Creating a group

     #+BEGIN_SRC hcl
       resource "gitlab_group" "blogs" {
         name        = "blogs"
         path        = "blogs"
         description = "Public blog repositories"
       }
     #+END_SRC

***** Creating a nested group

      I have a group on my GitLab site for ~infrastructure~ projects, and a
      nested group on my site for [[https://helm.sh/][Helm]] charts within that ~infrastructure~
      group. Here's the Terraform code that manages those two groups and their
      relationship:

      #+BEGIN_SRC hcl
        resource "gitlab_group" "infrastructure" {
          name        = "infrastructure"
          path        = "infrastructure"
        }

        resource "gitlab_group" "helm-charts" {
          name        = "helm-charts"
          path        = "helm-charts"
          parent_id   = "${gitlab_group.infrastructure.id}"
        }
      #+END_SRC

      Projects created within this child group will appear on the site at
      paths that look like ~/infrastructure/helm-charts/foo-chart~.

**** Creating a project within a group

     Here's the first example, a mirror of my public blog. Because of the
     nature of its contents, I've disabled most of the extra features offered
     by GitLab for this particular repository.

     #+BEGIN_SRC hcl :hl_lines 2,7
       resource "gitlab_project" "blogs-shanesveller-dot-com" {
         name                   = "shanesveller-dot-com"
         default_branch         = "master"
         description            = ""
         issues_enabled         = false
         merge_requests_enabled = false
         namespace_id           = "${gitlab_group.blogs.id}"
         snippets_enabled       = false
         visibility_level       = "public"
         wiki_enabled           = false
       }
     #+END_SRC

     With the highlighted lines in place, the repository path on the site
     becomes ~/blogs/shanesveller-dot-com~.

**** Closing Comments

     The GitLab provider as of 1.0.0 is missing some API coverage for what
     GitLab offers, and has some bugs associated with things like a project's
     default branch. Often I use ~git-flow~ and want to set a project's default
     branch to ~develop~, but that feature does not currently seem to work
     reliably due to
     [[https://github.com/terraform-providers/terraform-provider-gitlab/pull/41][this
     code typo]].

My home network is largely made up of Ubiquiti Unifi equipment.

**** Router

My router is a UBNT USG 3-port. I also own a 4-port USG Pro but cannot currently
tolerate the fan noise in an apartment, so that's still in the box.

**** Switching

I have a UBNT 24-port 250W POE switch for my main hub, as well as a UBNT 8-port
switch with POE passthrough for my TV stand so I can hard-wire my game consoles and
media devices.

   In no particular order, I endorse the following software, products and
   services on a personal level: # OSX Software

   - [[http://adium.im/][Adium]]
   - [[http://sprw.me/][Sparrow]] - no new development due to acquisition
     by Google is heartbreaking
   - [[http://mac.github.com][GitHub OSX client]]
   - [[http://reederapp.com/mac/][Reeder]] - Best RSS reader I've ever
     used, and it has a fantastic [[http://reederapp.com/ipad/][iOS port]]!
   - [[http://tapbots.com/tweetbot_mac/][TweetBot]] - Originally on
     [[http://tapbots.com/software/tweetbot/][iOS]], and is far and away my
     preferred Twitter client on both platforms. Beats the hell out of
     TweetDeck.
   - [[http://www.iterm2.com][iTerm 2]]
   - [[http://tmux.sourceforge.net][tmux]] - not OSX specific, but where I
     use it most

*** Cross-platform Software

    - [[http://dropbox.com/][Dropbox]] - still one of my favorite ways to
      keep files available on all my machines, including the iPad. Bonus:
      integration with
      [[http://pragprog.com/frequently-asked-questions/ebooks/read-on-desktop-laptop#dropbox][PragProg]]
      and
      [[http://shop.oreilly.com/category/customer-service/dropbox.do][O'Reilly]]
      for near-instant notificaiton of new e-book revisions!
    - [[http://sublimetext.com/2][SublimeText 2]] - see my 1-month
      impressions [[/posts/2012-08-05-sublimetext-2/][here]]!
    - [[http://spotify.com/][Spotify]] - the only streaming music service
      I'm still consistently glad I subscribe to. Works like a charm on
      Windows and OSX, and even has a
      [[http://spotify.com/us/download/previews/][Linux port]]!
    - [[https://kindle.amazon.com][Amazon Kindle]] - my preferred e-reader
      platform because it has great dedicated
      [[https://www.amazon.com/kindle-store-ebooks-newspapers-blogs/b/ref=r_ksl_h_i_gl?node=133141011][hardware
      readers]], and a reading app for pretty much
      [[https://www.amazon.com/gp/kindle/kcp/ref=r_kala_h_i_gl][every
      platform under the sun]].

*** Cloud/Web Apps

    - [[http://heroku.com/][Heroku]]
    - [[http://mint.com/][Mint]]
    - [[http://pinboard.in/][Pinboard]] - bookmarking service /ala/
      Delicious but without all the social trappings - and with great
      integration in Twitter clients/RSS readers!
    - [[http://pandora.com/][Pandora]] - I'm less happy with their variety
      than I wish, but still a great service

*** Screencasts

    - [[http://railscasts.com/][Railscasts]] - Ryan Bates has been
      consistently putting out focused, concise and informative screencasts
      on a variety of topics related to Ruby on Rails or programming at
      large. Congrats on a full year of doing RailsCasts full-time, Ryan!
      Happy to be a Pro subscriber.
    - [[https://peepcode.com/][PeepCode]] - May be less prolific than
      Railscasts, but the screencasts Geoffrey puts out are very meaty and
      I'm a big fan of the
      [[https://peepcode.com/products/play-by-play-tenderlove-ruby-on-rails][Play
      by Play series]].

*** Podcasts

    - [[http://ruby5.envylabs.com/][Ruby5]] is a great way to keep abreast
      of new or upcoming projects from the Ruby ecosystem
    - [[http://rubyrogues.com/][Ruby Rogues]] isn't nearly so bite-sized but
      dives deeper into subjects and often has very interesting guests

*** Reference Books

    - [[http://pragprog.com/][Pragmatic Programmers]] keeps publishing
      awesome books from great authors on exciting topics
    - [[http://www.manning.com/][Manning]] - I still buy the odd
      [[http://www.manning.com/about/meap][MEAP book]] on an upcoming
      technology and have yet to regret it
    - O'Reilly publishes most new books in an ebook format and sports
      integration with Dropbox for delivery of updated versions

*** E-Book Vendors

    - [[http://rpg.drivethrustuff.com/][DriveThruRPG]] has awesome sales on
      tabletop RPG rulebooks now and then - I've got a ton of
      [[http://www.white-wolf.com/classic-world-of-darkness][old]]/
      [[http://www.white-wolf.com/new-world-of-darkness][new World of
      Darkness]] and [[http://shadowrun4.com/][Shadowrun]], some
      Exalted/Trinity, and a dash of [[http://paizo.com/][Pathfinder]].
