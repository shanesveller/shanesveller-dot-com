   In no particular order, I endorse the following software, products and
   services on a personal level:

*** OSX Software

    - [[http://adium.im/][Adium]]
    - [[http://sprw.me/][Sparrow]] - no new development due to acquisition
      by Google is heartbreaking
    - [[http://mac.github.com][GitHub OSX client]]
    - [[http://reederapp.com/mac/][Reeder]] - Best RSS reader I've ever
      used, and it has a fantastic [[http://reederapp.com/ipad/][iOS port]]!
    - [[http://tapbots.com/tweetbot_mac/][TweetBot]] - Originally on
      [[http://tapbots.com/software/tweetbot/][iOS]], and is far and away my
      preferred Twitter client on both platforms. Beats the hell out of
      TweetDeck.
    - [[http://www.iterm2.com][iTerm 2]]
    - [[http://tmux.sourceforge.net][tmux]] - not OSX specific, but where I
      use it most

*** Cross-platform Software

    - [[http://dropbox.com/][Dropbox]] - still one of my favorite ways to
      keep files available on all my machines, including the iPad. Bonus:
      integration with
      [[http://pragprog.com/frequently-asked-questions/ebooks/read-on-desktop-laptop#dropbox][PragProg]]
      and
      [[http://shop.oreilly.com/category/customer-service/dropbox.do][O'Reilly]]
      for near-instant notificaiton of new e-book revisions!
    - [[http://sublimetext.com/2][SublimeText 2]] - see my 1-month
      impressions [[/posts/2012-08-05-sublimetext-2/][here]]!
    - [[http://spotify.com/][Spotify]] - the only streaming music service
      I'm still consistently glad I subscribe to. Works like a charm on
      Windows and OSX, and even has a
      [[http://spotify.com/us/download/previews/][Linux port]]!
    - [[https://kindle.amazon.com][Amazon Kindle]] - my preferred e-reader
      platform because it has great dedicated
      [[https://www.amazon.com/kindle-store-ebooks-newspapers-blogs/b/ref=r_ksl_h_i_gl?node=133141011][hardware
      readers]], and a reading app for pretty much
      [[https://www.amazon.com/gp/kindle/kcp/ref=r_kala_h_i_gl][every
      platform under the sun]].

*** Cloud/Web Apps

    - [[http://heroku.com/][Heroku]]
    - [[http://mint.com/][Mint]]
    - [[http://pinboard.in/][Pinboard]] - bookmarking service /ala/
      Delicious but without all the social trappings - and with great
      integration in Twitter clients/RSS readers!
    - [[http://pandora.com/][Pandora]] - I'm less happy with their variety
      than I wish, but still a great service

*** Screencasts

    - [[http://railscasts.com/][Railscasts]] - Ryan Bates has been
      consistently putting out focused, concise and informative screencasts
      on a variety of topics related to Ruby on Rails or programming at
      large. Congrats on a full year of doing RailsCasts full-time, Ryan!
      Happy to be a Pro subscriber.
    - [[https://peepcode.com/][PeepCode]] - May be less prolific than
      Railscasts, but the screencasts Geoffrey puts out are very meaty and
      I'm a big fan of the
      [[https://peepcode.com/products/play-by-play-tenderlove-ruby-on-rails][Play
      by Play series]].

*** Podcasts

    - [[http://ruby5.envylabs.com/][Ruby5]] is a great way to keep abreast
      of new or upcoming projects from the Ruby ecosystem
    - [[http://rubyrogues.com/][Ruby Rogues]] isn't nearly so bite-sized but
      dives deeper into subjects and often has very interesting guests

*** Reference Books

    - [[http://pragprog.com/][Pragmatic Programmers]] keeps publishing
      awesome books from great authors on exciting topics
    - [[http://www.manning.com/][Manning]] - I still buy the odd
      [[http://www.manning.com/about/meap][MEAP book]] on an upcoming
      technology and have yet to regret it
    - O'Reilly publishes most new books in an ebook format and sports
      integration with Dropbox for delivery of updated versions

*** E-Book Vendors

    - [[http://rpg.drivethrustuff.com/][DriveThruRPG]] has awesome sales on
      tabletop RPG rulebooks now and then - I've got a ton of
      [[http://www.white-wolf.com/classic-world-of-darkness][old]]/
      [[http://www.white-wolf.com/new-world-of-darkness][new World of
      Darkness]] and [[http://shadowrun4.com/][Shadowrun]], some
      Exalted/Trinity, and a dash of [[http://paizo.com/][Pathfinder]].
