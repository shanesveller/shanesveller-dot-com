My home network is largely made up of Ubiquiti Unifi equipment.


## Router {#router}

My router is a UBNT USG 3-port. I also own a 4-port USG Pro but cannot currently
tolerate the fan noise in an apartment, so that's still in the box.


## Switching {#switching}

I have a UBNT 24-port 250W POE switch for my main hub, as well as a UBNT 8-port
switch with POE passthrough for my TV stand so I can hard-wire my game consoles and
media devices.
