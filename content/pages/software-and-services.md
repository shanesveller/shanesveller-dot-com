In no particular order, I endorse the following software, products and
services on a personal level:


## OSX Software {#osx-software}

-   [Adium](http://adium.im/)
-   [Sparrow](http://sprw.me/) - no new development due to acquisition
    by Google is heartbreaking
-   [GitHub OSX client](http://mac.github.com)
-   [Reeder](http://reederapp.com/mac/) - Best RSS reader I've ever
    used, and it has a fantastic [iOS port](http://reederapp.com/ipad/)!
-   [TweetBot](http://tapbots.com/tweetbot_mac/) - Originally on
    [iOS](http://tapbots.com/software/tweetbot/), and is far and away my
    preferred Twitter client on both platforms. Beats the hell out of
    TweetDeck.
-   [iTerm 2](http://www.iterm2.com)
-   [tmux](http://tmux.sourceforge.net) - not OSX specific, but where I
    use it most


## Cross-platform Software {#cross-platform-software}

-   [Dropbox](http://dropbox.com/) - still one of my favorite ways to
    keep files available on all my machines, including the iPad. Bonus:
    integration with
    [PragProg](http://pragprog.com/frequently-asked-questions/ebooks/read-on-desktop-laptop#dropbox)
    and
    [O'Reilly](http://shop.oreilly.com/category/customer-service/dropbox.do)
    for near-instant notificaiton of new e-book revisions!
-   [SublimeText 2](http://sublimetext.com/2) - see my 1-month
    impressions [here](/posts/2012-08-05-sublimetext-2/)!
-   [Spotify](http://spotify.com/) - the only streaming music service
    I'm still consistently glad I subscribe to. Works like a charm on
    Windows and OSX, and even has a
    [Linux port](http://spotify.com/us/download/previews/)!
-   [Amazon Kindle](https://kindle.amazon.com) - my preferred e-reader
    platform because it has great dedicated
    [hardware
    readers](https://www.amazon.com/kindle-store-ebooks-newspapers-blogs/b/ref=r_ksl_h_i_gl?node=133141011), and a reading app for pretty much
    [every
    platform under the sun](https://www.amazon.com/gp/kindle/kcp/ref=r_kala_h_i_gl).


## Cloud/Web Apps {#cloud-web-apps}

-   [Heroku](http://heroku.com/)
-   [Mint](http://mint.com/)
-   [Pinboard](http://pinboard.in/) - bookmarking service _ala_
    Delicious but without all the social trappings - and with great
    integration in Twitter clients/RSS readers!
-   [Pandora](http://pandora.com/) - I'm less happy with their variety
    than I wish, but still a great service


## Screencasts {#screencasts}

-   [Railscasts](http://railscasts.com/) - Ryan Bates has been
    consistently putting out focused, concise and informative screencasts
    on a variety of topics related to Ruby on Rails or programming at
    large. Congrats on a full year of doing RailsCasts full-time, Ryan!
    Happy to be a Pro subscriber.
-   [PeepCode](https://peepcode.com/) - May be less prolific than
    Railscasts, but the screencasts Geoffrey puts out are very meaty and
    I'm a big fan of the
    [Play
    by Play series](https://peepcode.com/products/play-by-play-tenderlove-ruby-on-rails).


## Podcasts {#podcasts}

-   [Ruby5](http://ruby5.envylabs.com/) is a great way to keep abreast
    of new or upcoming projects from the Ruby ecosystem
-   [Ruby Rogues](http://rubyrogues.com/) isn't nearly so bite-sized but
    dives deeper into subjects and often has very interesting guests


## Reference Books {#reference-books}

-   [Pragmatic Programmers](http://pragprog.com/) keeps publishing
    awesome books from great authors on exciting topics
-   [Manning](http://www.manning.com/) - I still buy the odd
    [MEAP book](http://www.manning.com/about/meap) on an upcoming
    technology and have yet to regret it
-   O'Reilly publishes most new books in an ebook format and sports
    integration with Dropbox for delivery of updated versions


## E-Book Vendors {#e-book-vendors}

-   [DriveThruRPG](http://rpg.drivethrustuff.com/) has awesome sales on
    tabletop RPG rulebooks now and then - I've got a ton of
    [old](http://www.white-wolf.com/classic-world-of-darkness)/
    [new World of
    Darkness](http://www.white-wolf.com/new-world-of-darkness) and [Shadowrun](http://shadowrun4.com/), some
    Exalted/Trinity, and a dash of [Pathfinder](http://paizo.com/).
