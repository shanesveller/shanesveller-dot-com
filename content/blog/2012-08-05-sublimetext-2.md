It's been a full month since I purchased my license for
[SublimeText 2](http://www.sublimetext.com/2) and I couldn't be happier.
<!--more-->

Here are some highlights as to why:

* Cross-platform from a single purchase, works great on OSX and Windows 7 both
  (and Linux when I dabble there)
* Blazingly fast - seriously, go check out the trial
* Actively developed and supported - I'm looking at you, MacroMates!
* Native GUI is attractive on every platform:

* [Package Control](http://wbond.net/sublime_packages/package_control) is *amazing*
* Excellent syntax highlighting
* Very extensible - I have plugins for SCSS, [Guard](https://github.com/guard/guard), CoffeeScript, RSpec, and RubyMotion, to name a few
* Live, instant reloading of configuration files as soon as their changes are saved
* User-specific settings files which can't be nuked by version updates
