I got the idea for this post from [Robby on
Rails](http://www.robbyonrails.com/articles/2008/03/25/things-in-the-rails-
world-you-dont-yet-understand)...

Things I've been using/playing with lately:

  * [GitHub](http://www.github.com) / [Gitorious](http://gitorious.org)
  * [Braid](http://evil.che.lu/projects/braid) - here's a [braid with rspec tutorial](http://ropiku.wordpress.com/2008/02/04/installing-rspec-with-braid/)
  * [Railify](http://blog.citrusbyte.com/2008/3/24/creating-a-new-rails-app-shouldnt-be-boring) - [GitHub]
  * [Linode](http://www.linode.com)
  * [Nginx](http://nginx.net) with an [init script](http://articles.slicehost.com/2007/10/17/ubuntu-lts-adding-an-nginx-init-script)
  * [Wordpress 2.5 RC1](http://wordpress.org/development/2008/03/25-sneak-peek/) and now [RC2](http://wordpress.org/development/2008/03/wordpress-25-rc2/)

Things I'd really like to learn more about:

  * [RSpec](http://rspec.info)
  * [Merb](http://merbivore.org) - [[GitHub]](http://github.com/wycats/merb-core)
  * [LovdByLess open-source social network](http://github.com/stevenbristol/lovd-by-less/tree/master)

Things that sound cool but I know nothing about:

  * [StrokeDB](http://strokedb.com/) - an embeddable distributed document database written in Ruby.
  * Using gmail with linux daemons - anyone have any good tutorials? I'm specifically looking for using something like exim, sendmail, fetchmail, what have you with a Google Apps domain
